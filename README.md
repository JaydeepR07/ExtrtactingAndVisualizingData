I have extracted financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data I have visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I have worked with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
